Establishing Norms

What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?
  Discuss with other team member, and after a certain amount of time (10-15 mins) discuss with other group member and if need be, discuss with fellow.
  Typically, issues will be handled by majority, however if one member is very passionate about an issue they can all discuss with the fellow.

What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with?
